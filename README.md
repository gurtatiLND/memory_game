# What is about this game?

In this game you can flip two cards to see the image underneath and if they match they stay flipped, if they don't match then they turn back over. At the bottom of the screen, you're going to see a turn counter as well. And if you are going to start this game again you can click on the button at top of the screen 'New Game' and that's gonna shuffle the cards.
